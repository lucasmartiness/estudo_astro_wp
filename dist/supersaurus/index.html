		    <h2> Supersaurus </h2>
             
           
<p>Supersaurus was a large sauropod that
existed in the late Jurassic period. One of the largest dinosaurs of all time,
Supersaurus was 110 â€“ 125 feet long and weighed an estimated 40 tons. It had a
very long tail that it probably used to fend off potential predators, although
considering its size an adult Supersaurus would have been too powerful to be
preyed on.</p>



<p><strong>In Game</strong></p>



<p>Supersaurus is the largest and most
powerful creature in Pangaea. One of the three boss creatures in the game,
Supersaurus is different from other bosses in that it will not actively hunt
other players but it is extremely territorial and will not tolerate any other
creatures in its domain. It does insane amounts of damage and can kill most
creatures in the game in one strike. However, its attack speed is very slow and
it is quite sluggish in its movements. With careful planning and coordination,
Supersaurus can be taken down by groups of carnivores and once down it will
provide food for days.</p>
