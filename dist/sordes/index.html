		    <h2> Sordes </h2>
             
           
<p>Sordes is a very small Pterosaur that
lived in the late Jurassic period. They are very important in Paleontology as
they were the first Pterosaurs to show evidence of a fur like outer layer on
their body. </p>



<p><strong>Paleo Chronicles</strong></p>



<p>Sordes was very small with a wingspan
of 2 feet and a length of about 4 feet. They are thought to have eaten both
fish and small amphibians with their jaws being designed for crushing and
chewing. They had a short neck and a long tail that was over half its body
length. </p>



<p><strong>In Game Attributes</strong></p>



<p>Sordes is the fastest flyer in the
game and has higher stamina than the Pteranodon. They can only prey on fish and
they have low health and damage. However due to their size it is quite easy for
them to hide and evade capture.</p>



<p><strong>Preferred Biomes</strong></p>



<ul><li>Carnian Swamps</li><li>Grand River</li><li>Hushed Forests</li></ul>
