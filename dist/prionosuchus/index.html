		    <h2> Prionosuchus </h2>
             
           
<p>The largest amphibian that ever
roamed the planet, Prionosuchus lived in the Permian era. Shaped like a
crocodile with long narrow jaws, it is thought to be an ambush hunter like
modern crocodilians.</p>



<p><strong>Paleo Chronicles</strong></p>



<p>Prionosuchus was gigantic with a
length of 28 â€“ 33 feet and weighing up to 2 tons. It had more than 60 razor
sharp teeth in its jaws and likely preyed on anything in its domain. It was an
ambush hunter due its small limbs that would have made it slow on land. </p>



<p><strong>In Game Attributes</strong></p>



<p>Prionosuchus is one the largest
predators that stalks the water ways in Pangaea. It has a large amount of
health and decent damage. It is a very fast swimmer but it is slow on land. It can
only nest in water and is vulnerable to predation in its juvenile stages. </p>



<p><strong>Preferred Biomes</strong></p>



<ul><li>Carnian Swamps</li><li>Grand River</li></ul>
