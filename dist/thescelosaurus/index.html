<p>Thescelosaurus is a small ornithopod
from the Cretaceous period. It was one of the last dinosaurs to walk the planet
before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. </p>



<p><strong>Paleo Chronicles</strong></p>



<p>Thescelosaurus was 8 – 13 feet long
and weighed 200 – 300 kilograms. It had a slender, light body with sturdy hind
limbs and small wide arms. It was probably a herbivore but it could have
potentially feasted on small animals as well. It is considered is to a fast and
agile creature that would have preferred to live along streams and rivers.</p>



<p><strong>In Game Attributes</strong></p>



<p>Thescelosaurus is very fast and easy
to hide. It can inhabit small caves due to its slender build and it is not
affected by the swamp’s speed debuff as well. It has low health and damage so
they should avoid altercations with predators at all cost.</p>
