<p>Pteranodons are a species of
Pterosaurs from the late Cretaceous period. They are probably the most
well-known and researched species within their family with more than 1200
specimens unearthed over the years.</p>



<p><strong>Paleo Chronicles</strong></p>



<p>They were some of the largest flying
animals ever discovered with a body length of 6 feet and a wingspan of 23 â€“ 25
feet. They mainly hunted fish and are thought to have been able to immerse its
head and neck underwater to snatch unsuspecting prey. They had a characteristic
crest that many blood vessels, mainly in males, that were likely used in
courting. They also flew in a pattern similar to modern Albatrosses which was
mainly comprised of gliding and soaring with occasional bursts of rapid flapping.</p>



<p><strong>In Game Attributes</strong></p>



<p>Pteranodons are the largest flyers in
Pangaea and they mainly prey on fish, Sordes and juveniles of lower tier
dinosaurs. They can glide along the surface of water and snatch fish from the
surface with ease. They do very little damage and has very low health so they
should avoid combat with anything stronger than itself. They can nest on top of
large trees and rock formations to avoid predation. </p>
