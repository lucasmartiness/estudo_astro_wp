		    <h2> Rhizodus </h2>
             
           
<p>Rhizodus was the largest freshwater
fish that ever lived. It roamed the planet in the entirety of the Carboniferous
period and was probably the apex predator of the freshwater ecosystems. It was
almost 25 feet long and had fangs that were close to 9 inches in length. It
usually ripped apart its prey rather than swallow it whole. It has been
proposed that Rhizodus could lunge out of water like a crocodile to capture terrestrial prey.</p>



<p><strong>In Game</strong></p>



<p>Rhizodus is an AI controlled boss
creature that lurks around the Grand River and Carnian Swamps. It does very
high damage as well as the Bleed side effect. It is extremely aggressive and
will not hesitate to attack any creature in the water. </p>
